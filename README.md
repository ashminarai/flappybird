## Introduction 🎮

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game repository! This is a classic remake of the famous Flappy Bird game built using React and styled-components. The game challenges players to control a bird by clicking the screen to avoid pipes and score points.

## How to play 🕹️

Playing Flappy Bird is easy, but mastering it can be challenging. Follow these simple instructions to get started:

- Control the Bird: Your objective is to keep the bird flying. Click the screen to make the bird flap its wings. Each click gives the bird a little boost.
